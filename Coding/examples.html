                    Everybody knows the style that Disney use to make their movies. Throughout the years, Disney developped their business until becoming the largest production company in the world. Today, they are leading the market and produce around 2-3 movies each years.

                    "Monsters, Inc" (2001), "Up" (2009), "Inside Out" (2015) or even "Soul" (2020) are movie directed by Pete. In each one of these movies, we can find a pattern regarding the colors used or even the atmosphere in them. Even if in general Disneyâ€™s movies are colorful, those one are really over the limits.

                <p class="para-last-page">
                    The stop motion style is clearly less known than Disney style. However, it doesn't make is less good. For a quick explaination, the stop motion style is a filmmaking technique in which objects are physically manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames so that they will appear to exhibit independent motion or change when the series of frames is played back. This style is clearly one of the most under-rated by the public.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="para-last-page">
                    The most famous director who works (almost) always with stop motion is <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Anderson">Wes Anderson</a>. Aside of his movies made in stop motion, Wes is also known for "The Grand Budapest Hotel" or "The Royal Tenenbaums".

                    Wes had made two movies in stop motion, "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (2009) and "Isle Of Dogs" (2018). Both where nominated for the Academy Award For Best Animated Feature. Aside from Mr. Anderson, another movie which came out in 1993 made a lot of noise. Which one? "The Nightmare Before Christmas" of course, directed at the time by <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton">Tim Burton</a> and <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Selick">Henry Selick.</a>

                <br><br>
                <p class="para-last-page">
                    The japanese style isn't the most known style neither, even if it developped quite well in some country of Europe during the 80' and 90'. When we say Japanese style it doesn't really describe any type as all the movies/animes that came from the Asian continent are very different. However, we always find the same kind of cartoonish style for the mangas.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="para-last-page">
                   The probably most famous Japanese director known around the world is <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>. He is the one behind the Studio Ghibli and gave to the world a lot of very famous movies. He's also known to put a second level of reading in his movie, often refering to the environment, pacifism, feminism, love or even family.

                <p class="para-last-page">
                    Miyazaki is the one that gave us some masterpiece like "My Neighbour Totoro"(1988) that treats about <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">animism</a>, enivronment and the joy of rural living. "Princess Momonoke" (1997) which is about environmentalism as well and how the humans are destroying the planet. Or even "Spirited Away" (2001) that treats about environmentalism as well but also about Western consumerism and death.

                <p class="para-last-page">
                    For this last part, we wanted to talk about a bit about the animation in general, without really focusing on any style.  Before, w have talked about probably the most developped styles around the world, through the years, animation became more and more advanced, becoming progressively accurate and realistic (If the director wants it to be of course).
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="para-last-page">
                   For this last part, we wanted to talk about "Love, Death & Robots" (2019), an animation series released by Netflix and produced by <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher">David Fincher</a> and <a class="references" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Miller_(director)">Tim Miller</a>. In this series, each episodes are independent, none of them are related to another.Most of the episodes have a deeper meaning, criticising the society or adress an important issue. The most amazing thing regarding this series, is that each episode also have its own animation style. There are right now 26 episodes, which means that there is more or less 26 differents styles but as you can guess, we won't have tine to go through each one of them, we have therefore selected a few episodes for you.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="para-last-page">
                    For the first episode, we have chosen the 18th episode of the first season <a class="references" href="https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/The_Secret_War">"Secret War"</a>. We have chosen this episode for its realistic style. It's talking about Elite units of the Red Army that fight an unholy evil deep in the ancient forests of Siberia.<br>
                    For the second episode,<a class="references" href="https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/Sucker_of_Souls">"Sucker Of Souls"</a> has been chosen. Its cartoonish style makes you fall in love with the characters since the beginning of the episode. The synopsis of this second episode is: Unleashed by an archeological dig, a bloodthirsty vampire battles a team of mercenaries armed with... Cats?<br>
                    For this last chosen episode, we wanted to talked about <a class="references" href="https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/Ice">"Ice"</a> which is the third episode of the second season. Ice is about: In the future, humans are modded with enhancements to increase strength and endurance. The conflict between the modded and unmodded drives a rift between two brothers, who are new to a desolate ice planet, where they partake in a dangerous race with a local crew. We wanted to tell you about this one for its incredible animation "Hand-drawing" style. The plot isn't our favorite but it's style is definitely one of the most elaborated.
